### Notes on Coilgun Balance 2-3-2025

AryxLightCoilgunAmmoWC - to break shield face
* Most Lore-accurate potential would be to increase hit-scan radius from 1 block to 2 or 3 blocks

Reduced Shield Multiplier - Should break Corvette Max Shields, but not Frigate (in average cases)
Increased Reload time from 25s to 60s - Balance
Adjusted power cost to ~1.5GW while charging. Using this weapon includes a risk. If you are a tank, your shields won't charge as fast.
Increased linear damage ~7x - Allows for targets of opportunity if you can aim well enough
